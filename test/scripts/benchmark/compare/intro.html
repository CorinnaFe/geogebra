<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The following table shows benchmarking results of various tests for the available prover engines in GeoGebra:

<ul>
<li>Column "Classic5" refers to the Java version of GeoGebra (also known as "desktop" version).
"Classic5-rg" is the same application, but the elimination process (via Giac) is disabled: only realgeom is
used to compute the result of the Compare command.
<li>Column "Classic6" refers to the HTML/JavaScript version of GeoGebra (also known as "web" version).
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Explanation of the used colors:

<ul>
<li>Green means that the test returns a correct yes/no answer. Intensity of green
means speed (the lighter the slower). Numbers are in milliseconds.
<li>Yellow means the output is not conclusive, thus using this method
GeoGebra shows "undefined", i.e. there is no error here.
<li>The Result column provides information about the result, that is, the output
of the comparison.
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Speed column shows the timing.</p>

<p>Based on the output results the number of positive tests is shown at the bottom of the table.</p>
